# URL Copier Chrome Extension

This chrome extension allows you to copy the URL of your active tab by pressing keyboard shortcut `Alt + C`. You can also change it in the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) "Keyboard Shortcuts" tab. 

This is based on a feature in the ARC browser that saved me a lot of time.

## Installation
**Download** this repository. Next, open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), then turn on developer mode. Lastly, select "Load unpacked" in the top left corner, and select the folder.
